# Breast-Cancer
The project predicts whether the person has malign cancer or benign cancer. As the machine learning steps into the field of medicines the very first move is to predict whether the person is going through some disease or not by considering symptoms . Those symptoms are suggested by the specialist doctors of that field , and which symptoms contains more priority(weight) while predicting are suggested by them only. This breast cancer idea has spread widely as this was one of the most successful and needful project and idea of its time . The dataset contains the list of person who are already going through breast cancer .

## OUR TASK : 
As the dataset already contains the person who has breast(catogaries) cancer , our task is to divide them in subcatogaries that is whether they going through benign breast cancer or malign breast cancer.

## Solution 
As clearly we can see this is a problem of classification . We have used the most basic model of classification to train our dataset i.e. **Logisitic Regression** and the results we obtained were quite precise , **Accuracy** is calculated with **K-Fold Cross Validation** method and it came out to be 96.70% and the standard deviation was 1.96%.
